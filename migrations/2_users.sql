-- As a style choice, we prefer to avoid plurals in table names, mainly because it makes queries read better.
--
-- For our user table, quoting the table name is recommended by IntelliJ's tooling because `user` is a keyword,
-- though Postgres seems to handle it fine in most contexts either way.
create table "user"
(
    -- Having the table name as part of the primary key column makes it nicer to write joins, e.g.:
    --
    -- select * from "user"
    -- inner join article using (id)
    --
    -- as opposed to `inner join article on article.id = user.id`, and makes it easier to keep track of primary
    -- keys as opposed to having all PK columns named "id"
    id       uuid primary key                                default uuid_generate_v1mc(),

    -- By applying our custom collation we can simply mark this column as `unique` and Postgres will enforce
    -- case-insensitive uniqueness for us, and lookups over `username` will be case-insensitive by default.
    --
    -- Note that this collation doesn't support the `LIKE`/`ILIKE` operators so if you want to do searches
    -- over `username` you will want a separate index with the default collation:
    --
    -- create index on "user" (username collate "ucs_basic");
    --
    -- select * from "user" where (username collate "ucs_basic") ilike ($1 || '%')
    --
    -- We're not doing that here since the Realworld spec doesn't implement a search function for users.
    username      text collate "case_insensitive" unique not null,

    email         text collate "case_insensitive" unique not null,

    -- The spec however, does show this field as nullable.

    -- The Argon2 hashed password string for the user.
    password_hash text                                   not null,

    -- If you want to be really pedantic you can add a trigger that enforces this column will never change,
    -- but that seems like overkill for something that's relatively easy to enforce in code-review.
    created_at    timestamptz                            not null default now(),
