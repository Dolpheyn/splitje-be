/// Contains definitions for application-specific parameters to handler functions,
/// such as `AuthUser` which checks for the `Authorization: Token <token>` header in the request,
/// verifies `<token>` as a JWT and checks the signature,
/// then deserializes the information it contains.

/// A catch-all module for other common types in the API. Arguably, the `error` and `extractor`
/// modules could have been children of this one, but that's more of a subjective decision.

// although the `articles` module also includes the `GET /api/tags` route because it touches
// the `article` table.

// This is not the order they were written in; `rustfmt` auto-sorts them.
// However, you should follow the order they were written in because some of the comments
// are more stream-of-consciousness and assume you read them in a particular order.
